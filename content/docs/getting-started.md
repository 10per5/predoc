# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) — primary build method

* Or [premake5](https://premake.github.io/download) + C++23 compiler + Qt6 + Saucer for native builds

Hugo and the Book theme are downloaded automatically by `predoc fetch-deps`.

## Quick Start

Builds are orchestrated by [predep](https://github.com/10per5/predep), which compiles itself from source and follows the recipes in [`predep.toml`](https://github.com/10per5/predoc/blob/main/predep.toml) files throughout the project.

```bash
# Build CLI + GUI + Editor JS
predep build

# Or build via Docker
predep build-docker

# Launch the editor
predoc $PATH_TO_CONTENT
```

## Build Steps

All build recipes are declared in `predep.toml` at each subproject root, the root [`predep.toml`](https://github.com/10per5/predoc/blob/main/predep.toml) ties them together via `[[include]]` directives and defines the top-level `build` and `build-docker` stage groups.

### Build Artifacts

```
gui/bin/predoc-gui             # ~1.2MB — GUI binary (links Qt6 at runtime)
editor/public/assets/app.js  # Editor frontend JS (minified)
editor/public/assets/app.css # Editor frontend CSS (minified)
editor/public/index.html     # Static HTML shell
ssg/
  hugo.toml                  # Hugo configuration
  themes/book/               # Hugo Book theme (downloaded on fetch-deps)
```

These are the only files needed at runtime. Source files (`gui/src/`, `editor/src/`) and dev dependencies are not needed on the target machine.
